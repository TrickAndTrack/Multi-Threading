# Multi-Threading
The total process is called a thread.

```
class myThread extends Thread{
// we have to override run method
public void run(){
//This is a job of thread & executed by child thread
for(i=1; i<10; i++){
sout("child thread");
}
}
}
```
```
class myThreadDemo {

// main method also is a thread 
public static void main(String[] arg){

// thread instansiation
myThread myThread = new myThread();
myThread.start(); // starting of thread
//& executed by Main thread
for(i=1; i<10; i++){
sout("child thread");
}

}
}
```

> main thread creates object thread and main thread started child thread


Case 2 ex.
```
class myThread extends Thread{
// we have to override run method
public void run(){
//This is a job of thread & executed by child thread
for(i=1; i<10; i++){
sout("child thread");
}
}
}
```

case 4:

```
class myThread extends Thread{
// this are the overloaded method
public void run(){
sout("no-arg-method");
}
public void run(int i){
sout("int arg run");
}
}
}
```

```
class myThreadDemo {


public static void main(String[] arg){
myThread myThread = new myThread();
myThread.start(); 


}
}
```
> o/p: no-arg run
